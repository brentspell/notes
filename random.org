  ** chantrix, csp, and client-side middleware
  ** backpressure inversion
  ** causal delivery vs. causal consistency
  ** interval tree monoid
  ** consensus everywhere

* todo
  ** recreate headshot with circle
  ** vectorlog:
    *** fixed-length index files, preallocated
      **** index record: offset, length, hlc, crc - 36 bytes
    *** tree (combined) hash in index footer
    *** data-only data files, preallocate? what about large blobs?
    *** this will not work without complete vector clocks, otherwise don't know how to delay delivery
    *** can we use plausible vclocks for causality and full vectors for cursoring?
      **** no

  ** chantrix rate limiter

  ** use quadratic cost for linear regression nn
  ** numpy polyfit
  ** decision trees have voting heuristic
  ** scale number training epochs proportionally to training set size when computing learning curves
    *** ditto for regularization parameter
  ** get more training data
    *** rotate MNIST images slightly
  ** use squashed gaussians as default weights (small variance parameter 1/Ninput)
    *** use standard normal for biases (or zeroes)

  ** unsupervised sentiment analysis
  ** lstm for generation?
  ** send link to arjun
