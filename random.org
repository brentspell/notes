  ** use quadratic cost for linear regression nn
  ** numpy polyfit
  ** decision trees have voting heuristic
  ** scale number training epochs proportionally to training set size when computing learning curves
    *** ditto for regularization parameter
  ** get more training data
    *** rotate MNIST images slightly
  ** use squashed gaussians as default weights (small variance parameter 1/Ninput)
    *** use standard normal for biases (or zeroes)

  ** unsupervised sentiment analysis
  ** lstm for generation?
