  * Gender of voices
  * Personalities of voices
  * Emotion
  * Multiple voices
  * Artifical humanity/Use of first person
  * Synthetic vs. recorded
  * Dyads, misrecognition and errors

* General Themes
  * Lots of experiments, excessively documented
  * Human voice processing has evolved to be highly sophisticated
  * The brain attempts to view every aspect of every utterance as meaningful
  * Consistency is almost always better (gender, emotion, etc.)
  * Similarity implies familiarity and is generally better (opposites attract is misleading)
  * Socially inept interfaces suffer the same fate as inept individuals - innective, criticized, and shunned

* Gender
  * Gender is one of the first attributes identified upon contact
  * Humans assign gender even to generated voices, expect gendered voices for gendered products
  * Males prefer male voices, females prefer female voices
  * Male voices are interpreted as more trustworthy, even by females
  * Masculinity and feminity are not one-dimensional (similar to dominance/submission)
  * Clarity of gender reduces confusion and cognitive burden

* Personality, Race
  * If gender is the most basic means of classifying, personality is richest
  * Extroverts vs. introverts, likes attract
  * Considered orthogonal to masculinity, feminity
  * Challenge to consistency: huge amount of existing content (reviews, etc.)
  * BMW car anecdote - chose "copilot" persona over kitt, chauffeur, friend, golf buddy, sidekick, back-seat driver/in-law
  * Extroverts are more concerned with similarity than consistency, introverts are more concerned with consistency than similarity
  * Accents are determined by location, not race
  * Speech manifests cultural origins, faces/skin manifest biological origins

* Emotion
  * Challenge - emotion is a "state," not a "trait"
  * Long-term emotions are called moods
  * Temperament is tendency to exhibit particular moods with great frequency
  * Primary emotions - fear, anger, sadness, joy, disgust
  * Similarity and consistency again
  * Systems should be slightly emotionally positive
  * Inconsistency between verbal and vocal cues can cause behavioral/emotional problems in children
  * Emotion of voice should match emotion of content
  * Challenge - determining emition of a text (sentiment analysis?)
  * Dimensions - valence (positive/negative), arousal, control
  * Emotions can be contagious

* Multiple Voices
  * In general, avoid mixing recorded and synthetic voices, even though doing so seems sophisticated
  * Distinctions - pitch range, volume, volume range, timbre
  * Distinct voices are perceived as distinct identities
  * Option - one voice as generalist, one voice as specialist
    * Challenge - generalist can appear incompetent
  * Multiple voices can be manipulative, since multiple adherents to a position can be more convincing

* Artifical humanity/Use of first person
  * People are oystercatchers - trigger easily based on artificial social cues
  * Using first person implies a level of sophistication/humanity that most technologies cannot meet
  * Recorded voices can use first person, synthetic voices should not
  * People generally prefer recorded voices
  * Synthetic speech is perceived as being more formal
  * Avoiding first person can allow the system to deflect blame from itself

* Synthetic vs. recorded
  * Don't look the look if you can't talk the talk
  * Synchrony between faces and voices is important
  * Synthetic faces should be avoided, but characters like Lamb Chop are acceptable because they don't have voices any human would have
  * Somatotype theory - 3 body/personality types (endomorph, ectomorphs, mesomorphs)
  * See appendix on page 141
  * Avoid mindless maximization (using advanced tech for its own sake)
    * Attempt to keep all aspects in balance w.r.t. quality
    * Don't be a show-off
  * Humor is powerful - see notes on jokes (p. 154)
  * TTCT (Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking)
  * Area microphones are better than cramped, visible mics, limits feelings of being monitored, which affect creativity, divulgence, etc.

* Dyads, Misrecognition and Errors
  * A computer and its user form a dyad
  * Self-serving bias - each member takes ownership of success, no responsibility of failure
  * Modesty is believed to be true, can lead user to think partner is incompetent
  * A better way is scapegoating, but difficult to attribute root cause to speech recognition problems
  * Users will automatically mirror the interface - similar to how a listener will adapt to speed, volume, etc. of human conversant
  * Three conversational maxims - quantity, relevance, clarity
