* goals
  * causal delivery
  * efficient anti-entropy
  * corruption tolerance
  * optional (quorum reads/writes)
  * geographic replication

* fundamental rules
  * clients (publishers) must own/generate idempotency ids, in order to guarantee at least once publication
  * servers (subscribers) must enforce idempotency for exactly once delivery

* fixed-length index files, preallocated
  * index record: offset, length, hlc, crc - 36 bytes
* tree (combined) hash in index footer
* data-only data files, preallocate? what about large blobs?
* this will not work without complete vector clocks, otherwise don't know how to delay delivery
* can we use plausible vclocks for causality and full vectors for cursoring?
  * no

* consider plausible clocks
  * lose optimal anti-entropy
  * can delay messages arbitrarily
  * can't change size of vector clock without rehashing existing events

* consider vnodes
  * vnode encapsulates all state for an entry in the vector clock
  * limits writer scalability to at most N (can be increased with reconfig)
  * passive read replicas can be added elastically with no coordination
  * reconfig requires consensus or taking whole system down
  * requires consensus or ops to ensure at most one process owns a vnode
  * consider consistent/rendezvous hashing
  * can use vclock compression to limit payload sizes (see efficient vector clocks paper)

* disconnected clients (non-vnodes)
  * what is causal context vector stamp when multiple dependent events are logged disconnectedly?
  * need to update causal context in subsequent events as predecessors are given "real" vector stamps (possibly only for the p-th entry)

* vectorlog assumes everybody gets everything (no built-in partitioning)
  * with archival + shared nothing, partitioning is unnecessary
  * as a message bus, partitioning is unnecessary
